# Creating Extension Icons

You need to create three icon files for the extension:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)  
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

You can:
1. Create simple colored square icons with the letter "T" or a terriyaki emoji 🍱
2. Use an online icon generator
3. Use a design tool like Figma or Canva

For now, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images as placeholders.
